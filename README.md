# Track Covid-19

**About**

This is my first public android project to check Covid-19 reports of your country and other nations.
The application auto detects the location and returns with you country data on top. You can browse through other nation datas and come back to your nation with the click of a button.
This is a growing project with local data of different nations to be soon added. You can help me out by requesting an issue with the api details that provide with local data.
